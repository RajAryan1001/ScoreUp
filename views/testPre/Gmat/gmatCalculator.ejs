            <h2>How to Use the GMAT Score Calculator</h2>
            <p>Follow these steps to calculate your GMAT score:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Input your raw scores in the calculator above and click on ‘Calculate Total Score’.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The calculator will show you your overall score as well as your percentile.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Test different score combinations to create a focused, efficient study plan.</li>
            </ol>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Power of Sectional Score Combinations</h2>
            <p>The GMAT uses a weighted scoring system, meaning different sectional score combinations can result in the same total score. This allows you to leverage your strengths strategically to maximize your performance.</p>
            <p>You don’t need to excel in every section to achieve a top GMAT score. If you maximize your strengths, they can compensate for the weaker ones. Instead of striving for perfection across all sections, a smart approach prioritizes high-impact improvements while managing weaker areas strategically.</p>

            <h2>Reverse Engineering Your Target Score Using Percentiles</h2>
            <p>A key strategy for GMAT preparation is reverse engineering your target score—working backwards to determine the exact sectional scores needed to reach your desired total score. Understanding percentile insights makes this approach even more effective.</p>

            <h3>Set Your Target</h3>
            <p>Start by identifying your desired total GMAT score and determining the percentiles needed in each section to reach that goal. If your goal is to be in the 90th percentile or higher, you must decide whether to boost weaker sections or strengthen your high-scoring areas.</p>

            <h3>Analyze Your Current Percentiles</h3>
            <p>Your current percentile ranking determines where you should focus your efforts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Below 50th Percentile:</strong> High Growth Potential. Strengthen core concepts and prioritize accuracy before working on speed.</li>
              <li><strong>50th–85th Percentile:</strong> Efficiency & Strategy Matter. Refine your test-taking approach, manage time effectively, and minimize errors.</li>
              <li><strong>85th–99th Percentile:</strong> Mastery & Precision Needed. Fine-tune advanced skills, optimize time allocation, and manage test-day stress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Plan Your Preparation</h3>
            <p>If one section is significantly weaker, determine whether you can offset it by excelling in the other sections. However, remember that improving a higher percentile score is more difficult whereas boosting a lower percentile score is often easier with targeted practice.</p>
            <p>What looked like a weakness can magically turn into your strongest section! All possible through a focused study plan emphasizing concept building, gap identification, and targeted practice.</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Final Considerations</h2>
            <p>With a clear understanding of GMAT percentiles and weighted scoring, you can now develop a data-driven preparation strategy.</p>
            <p>Use the GMAT Score Calculator to experiment with different sectional score combinations and see how they impact your total score.</p>
            <p>By letting percentile rankings guide your preparation, you can maximize your strengths, improve weak areas efficiently, and optimize your overall performance. This targeted approach ensures your study efforts are focused, effective, and strategic.</p>
