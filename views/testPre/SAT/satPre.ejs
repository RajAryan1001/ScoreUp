            <h2>What is the Digital SAT Exam?</h2>
            <p>The SAT is a standardized test widely used for undergraduate admissions in the United States and a few other countries. The Digital SAT is the online version of the SAT exam. SAT or ACT scores are mandatory for many colleges. The purpose of the SAT exam is to measure the college readiness of students. The SAT exam is conducted by the College Board organization and is often an important factor for students considering studying abroad.</p>
            <p>In India, nearly 35 universities accept the SAT score for admissions, and the list is growing. A good SAT score can also help students secure scholarships and fee waivers.</p>

            <h2>How to Prepare for the SAT Exam</h2>
            <p>The SAT exam is more than 2 hours long. The composite score for the SAT ranges from 400 to 1600, which is the sum of the SAT Reading, SAT Writing, and SAT Math section scores.</p>
            <p>Students can opt for self-study or coaching classes depending on their needs. Both options have distinct advantages. Good time management and English-speaking skills are essential for SAT preparation. The first step in SAT preparation is to study books and newspaper articles regularly, and the second step is to practice test papers regularly. SAT preparation typically takes about three months. SAT coaching can be beneficial for beginners, and solving previous year papers can help re-takers strengthen their weak areas.</p>
