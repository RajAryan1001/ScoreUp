                        <p>Every GMAT test-taker dreams of a great score and that is quite attainable by means of thorough and consistent preparation. In the case of most computer-based tests, the test-taker is advised to practice on simulated mock tests which will not only have the relevant questions but also give an actual feel of the test. However, there is a slight difference when it comes to a GMAT test-taker.</p>
                        
                        <p>The GMAT test-taker can warm up on the question types by using the best GMAT books, printed test-prep materials, reference books, and guides or choosing for study abroad programs. It is important to get a hang of the question types as there are different types of questions at different levels of difficulty, which are quite unfamiliar to several test-takers. When you know the questions types as well as answering strategies, you can confidently take on the simulated practice tests on the computer.</p>
                        
                        <p>We, at Manya-The Princeton Review, understand the test-prep requirement of a GMAT test-taker and hence provide all-inclusive support. With our unmatched support, you will gain access to relevant GMAT study material, both printed and online (web-based). The reference GMAT study material includes:</p>
