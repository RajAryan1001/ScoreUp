                        <p>Before deciding on GMAT dates, the candidate should consider the following factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When should you apply to business school and when is the deadline?</li>
                            <li>It is essential to start planning at least 10 months in advance.</li>
                            <li>Make a GMAT exam date appointment at least 6 months before the deadline.</li>
                            <li>Only then the candidate will have the option of retaking the GMAT at a later date.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Target Timeline for Admission</h2>
                        <p>If you're an MBA aspirant, it is very important to map out your timelines for preparation. Some points to keep in mind:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is wise to complete your GMAT by the spring or summer, in time for the early decision rounds (September to October) for various leading MBA programs across the world.</li>
                            <li>Completing the GMAT early in the year also means you can focus on other aspects of the application process.</li>
                            <li>However, if participating in the early decision rounds for universities is not a priority, you can also aim to complete the GMAT by October or November.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>Target GMAT Score</h2>
                        <p>Setting a target for yourself is a helpful step in preparation. Setting a target also depends on the programs you are looking at, which can vary significantly.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a good idea to research previous GMAT percentile categories.</li>
                            <li>Generally, the very best MBA programs expect candidates to be in the top 10%, meaning a score of 710 or higher.</li>
                            <li>To score in the top 25% of test takers however, you need a score of about 660.</li>
                            <li>An average GMAT score is generally at the 550 mark.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important to remember that your target score should be unique to you and set based on the programs you're aiming for. Different university programs judge scores differently, and this is only one part of the application process.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>Assessing Current Ability with GMAT Mock Tests</h2>
                        <p>You can only set your target score if you can correctly estimate your abilities. Frequently attempting GMAT mock tests is the best way to understand your baseline score and quickly identify which topic areas need the most improvement and practice.</p>
                        <p>There are countless free GMAT tests available online, which accurately simulate the actual test, down to question format and timing.</p>
                        <p>Regularly schedule mock tests throughout your planned study period to track your progress, set target scores and focus your practice.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>Estimate GMAT Prep Time</h2>
                        <p>Simply put, your required prep time depends on your mock scores during preparation. What is your baseline score and how far away are you from your target score?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A report by the official GMAT website found that candidates with a score of 700+ reported a study time of about 100 hours.</li>
                            <li>Those with a score below 500 reported a study time of about 50 hours on average.</li>
                            <li>You can use GMAT's interactive tool to get an estimate on your study time, based on your mock scores.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, if you're aiming for a high score, you may want to invest 100 to 150 hours on prep. However there are other considerations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For Full-Time Professionals: You may want to spread your study across 3-4 months.</li>
                            <li>Intensive Study: If you can dedicate lots of time to study, you can also complete prep in under 2 months.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No matter your prep time, plan to include study, review and mock test periods for best results.</p>

                        <p>If an unfortunate situation arises, you can reschedule or cancel your GMAT exam date up to 24 hours before the test. Cancellation, rescheduling fees, or refunds are calculated based off local mandates of the GMAC and how close to the test date you made the request.</p>

                        <p>Test dates are available throughout the year, but you need to plan your GMAT 5 to 6 months in advance to get the desired score. Look for test centers in or near your area. There are several test centers available in the metro and other cities. Consider distance, location, and reviews of the test center. The quality of the test center matters a lot.</p>
                        <p>Go through the registration instructions on mba.com cautiously before or while preparing for the GMAT to ensure that you understand the integrities of the GMAT and other registration guidelines, especially if you're considering a study abroad program. You would not like to surprise yourself with new information at the last moment. For example, you should have a valid passport when taking the test.</p>
                        <p>Research preferred B-schools before you start prepping for the GMAT. Check the GMAT score eligibility for each school in order to plan your GMAT preparation. A higher GMAT target score implies more time for preparation.</p>
                        <p>Take a couple of mock tests to know where you stand and how much preparation time is needed. This will aid you in deciding the test date. Lastly, check special scheduling instructions if you have a disability and require any testing accommodations.</p>
