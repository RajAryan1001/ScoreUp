The exam is available both online and offline (at designated exam centers). Here’s a detailed description of the GMAT exam eligibility for the candidates appearing for it in 2024:</p>

            <p>Candidates must note that while sitting for the GMAT does not require any academic qualification, B-Schools do require an undergraduate degree, especially MBA schools abroad.

            <p>You need to wait a minimum of 16 days after taking the exam before you sit for a retest.</p>

            <h3>Language Requirements</h3>
            <p>The standardized language in which GMAT is held is the English language.</p>
            <p>As per the GMAT exam eligibility criteria, you will need to have a basic understanding and fluency in English as a non-native speaker if you want to appear for this exam. Make sure your GMAT exam preparation aligns with this requirement.</p>

            <h3>Score Eligibility Requirements</h3>
            <p>Overall GMAT exam score range: 200-800 for the 10th Edition and 205-805 for the Focus Edition.</p>

            <p>Top school range: Competitive programs typically seek GMAT exam scores of 600-700+.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>You are not required to have any professional experience to be eligible for the GMAT exam. However, most prominent B-schools with leading MBA programs may require you to have 2 to 5 years of industrial experience complementing your academic achievement.</p>
            <p>Annually, there are thousands of GMAT test takers who have a minimum of 3-4 years of professional experience registering for the GMAT.</p>
            <p>After the application process begins, the admissions committee will first evaluate the applicant’s work experience and how it is relevant to the modern business environment.</p>
